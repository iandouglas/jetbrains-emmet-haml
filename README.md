jetbrains-emmet-haml
====================

Collection of emmet.io shortcuts for JetBrains editors for HAML documents

File locations to symlink (so far):

| OS | Editor/Version | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu 13.10 | PyCharm 3.0x (Pro) | `~/.PyCharm30/config/templates/` |
| Mac OS X Mavericks | RubyMine 5.4 | `~/Library/Preferences/RubyMine50/templates` |


If you find other file locations based on OS/editor/version, please add it to this README.

Cautions
--------
1. If you make edits to this Live Template within a JetBrains editor, it may remove your symlink.
1. Adding this file to RubyMine wants to remove the Python and Django flags on each element. Tips to fix this are welcome.

Contribute
----------
Contributions are more than welcome.
