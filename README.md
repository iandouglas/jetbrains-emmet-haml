jetbrains-emmet-haml
====================

Collection of emmet.io shortcuts for JetBrains editors for HAML documents

File locations to symlink (so far):

| OS | Editor/Version | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu 13.10 | PyCharm 3.0x (Pro) | `~/.PyCharm30/config/templates/` |
| Mac OS X Mavericks | PyCharm 2.x | `~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm20/templates` |
| Mac OS X Mavericks | PyCharm 3.x | `~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm30/templates` |
| Mac OS X Mavericks | RubyMine 5.x | `~/Library/Preferences/RubyMine50/templates` |
| Mac OS X Mavericks | RubyMine 6.x | `~/Library/Preferences/RubyMine60/templates` |


If you find other file locations based on OS/editor/version, please add it to this README.

Cautions
--------
1. If you make edits to this Live Template within a JetBrains editor, it may remove your symlink.
1. Adding this file to RubyMine wants to remove the Python and Django flags on each element. Tips to fix this are welcome.
